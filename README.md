# Harry Potter's Invisibilty Cloak using Python and Open CV
Implementation of Application of Open CV in a fun way creating an invisibility effect for the colour blue
# Basic idea:
Clicking a picture of the desired background preferably where you are trying this and storing it.
Detection of a colour(Blue in this case)
Now masking the chosen colour over the background picture, creating an illusion of pass through vision

# Possible errors/cons
1. Not recognising cv2 module(Fix = changing python interpreter)
2. Its still isnt perfect(Pixated kinda)

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Open CV
# Running locally
1. Clone the repo
2. run `pip install opencv-python`
3. Firstly run the `background.py` file to capture a picture
4. Then run the `invisible_cloak.py`
5. Have funn!
